<h1>Open95Keygen PSX</h1> 
<p>by Alex Free</p>

<p>Open95Keygen PSX is an open source Playstation 1 homebrew program that generates random valid Product Keys (both OEM and Retail types) for Microsoft's Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 operating systems. It is a port of my <a href=https://alex-free.github.io/open95keygen>Open95Keygen</a> program to the PSX.</p>

<p>The Windows 95/NT 4.0 OEM/Retail Product Key algorithms have been reverse engineered by many people. Open95Keygen is a <b><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design>clean room design</a></b> implementation not based on any existing software, it is written based on the specifications of the algorithm which is <b>inherently not copyright infringement</b>. I was inspired to write Open95Keygen after watching the YouTuber <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3S8vxwRfqLBdIhgRlDRVzw>stack smashing's</a> video <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwyH59nACzQ>Why 111-1111111 is a valid Windows 95 key</a>.</p>

<a name=compat><h2>Supported Consoles</h2></a>

<p><b>All</b> consoles are supported. You will need to use a swap trick (use the OG <a href=https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/916392-playstation/faqs/4708>Swap Trick Guide</a> from 1996) or boot disc (such as the PSX Change)if your console does not have a modchip installed. You'll need a dual analog, dual shock, or standard digital pad controller.</p> 

<a name=usage><h2>Usage</h2></a>

<p>First, <a href="#downloads">download</a> the right release for your console, or compile Open95Keygen PSX from <a href="#install_source">source</a>.</p>
<p>Burn and boot a CD-R, or load the standalone .exe by other means.</p>
<p>Make sure a controller is connected, and simply press the cross button. Retail and OEM Product Keys will be displayed. You can press the cross button for even more keys as much as you want.</p>

<a name=changelog><h2>Changelog</h2></a>

<p>Version 1.0 - 5/11/2021</p>
<ul><li>First release.</li></ul>

<a name=install_source><h2>Install From Source</h2></a>

<p>Open95Keygen PSX is made using <a href=https://github.com/Lameguy64/>Lameguy64's</a> <a href=https://github.com/Lameguy64/PSn00bSDK>PSn00bSDK</a> and <a href=https://github.com/Lameguy64/mkpsxiso>MKPSXISO</a>. This is the expected setup:</p>

<ul><li>MKPSXISO somewhere in your <code>$PATH</code>.</li>
<li>MIPS-unknown-elf toolchain at <code>/usr/local/mips-unknown-elf</code>.</li>
<li>PSn00bSDK at <code>/usr/local/mips-unknown-elf/psn00bsdk</code>.</li>
<li><b>(Optional)</b> pcsxr somewhere in your <code>$PATH</code>.</li></ul>

<p>Next you need to place the file <code>LICENSEA.DAT</code> (for building US bin+cue) and or <code>LICENSEJ.DAT</code> (for building Japan bin+cue) in the same directory as the makefile to license the built images. These files can be obtained from the official PSX PSYQ SDK.</p>

<p>Make rules:</p>

<ul><li><code>make</code> - just build o95kg.exe.</li>
<li><code>make us-cd</code> - build o95kg.exe and create bin+cue files for american playstations.</li>
<li><code>make jp-cd</code> - build o95kg.exe and create bin+cue files for japanese playstations.</li>
<li><code>make clean</code> - delete any files built with an above rule.</li>
<li><code>make test</code> - Load your previously created bin+cue files with the PCSXR emulator.</li></ul>
